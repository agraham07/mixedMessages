# Mixed Messages Project

*Purpose

The purpose of this project was to test myself on combining a lot of the skills I have learned over the past few months. This project only gave an end goal with some pre-requisites. I do believe I have met all of them. 

**Skills Used

In this project I utilized VSCode from start to finish, worked on debugging from the terminal, combined html, css, and js into one working website. The challenging part of the HTML was using a table as the body of the file and configuring it in CSS to match my goals for the website. In the JS file I practiced with classes as I felt it was a struggle point for me. After setting the classes for each "feeling" the next difficulty was using the correct syntax to addEventListeners and concatenate multiple different image files together in arrays. It all came together and produced a pretty nice first project.
